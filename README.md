# VBA-Challenge
UCSD Data Visualization Bootcamp - Module 2 Challenge - VBA

I really struggled to find the ClosingPrice. I looked online for 2 days, looked through all course materials, asked BCS, asked my instructor, and asked people in my class. 
I tried nested loops, different formulas, etc and I have had absolutely no luck. This made it so my calculations were off for YearlyChange, PercentChange, Greatest % Increase, and Greatest % Decrease.
